# Shopify App for integrating RE2

This app does not use the Shopify CLI, rather it relies heavily on https://github.com/Shopify/shopify_python_api

The backend uses FastAPI (https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi)

The front end uses then environments (window) Shopify AppBridge with vanilla JavaScript.
